# @bebraw/project-defaults

My project defaults to share across projects

**Usage:**

1. `npm install @bebraw/project-defaults -D`
2. Add `"postinstall": "project-defaults -t react"` to npm `"scripts"`. That will copy files around as you work.

> This doesn't manage dependencies like Babel or ESLint yet. Still need to find a good approach for that.
